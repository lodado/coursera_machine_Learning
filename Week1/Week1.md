##### What is Machine Learning? 
 
> Arthur Samuel (1959) : Field of
study that gives computers the ability to learn
without being explicitly programmed.  
> New capability for computers
> Tom Mitchell (1998) Well-posed Learning
Problem: A computer program is said to learn
from experience E with respect to some task T
and some performance measure P, if its
performance on T, as measured by P, improves
with experience E. 
 
In conclusion,  

E - experience 

T - task and performance

P - measure(Probability)

##### Examples
> - Database mining 
> - Applications canâ€™t program by hand
> - Self-customizing programs
> - Understanding human learning
