## Introduction


##### What is Machine Learning? 

> Tom Mitchell (1998) : Well-posed Learning
Problem- A computer program is said to learn
from experience E with respect to some task T
and some performance measure P, if its
performance on T, as measured by P, improves
with experience E. 
 
In conclusion,  

E - experience 

T - task and performance

P - measure(Probability)

##### Examples
> - Database mining 
> - Applications canâ€™t program by hand
> - Self-customizing programs
> - Understanding human learning

Machine Learning algorithms

1. Supervised Learning 
> regression(continuous) 
> classification(discrete)

2. UnsuperVised Learning
> clustering 
> non - clustering (ex - cocktail party Algorithm)
