## Introduction


##### What is Machine Learning? 

> Tom Mitchell (1998) : Well-posed Learning
Problem- A computer program is said to learn
from experience E with respect to some task T
and some performance measure P, if its
performance on T, as measured by P, improves
with experience E. 
 
In conclusion,  

E - Experience 

T - Task and performance

P - Measure(Probability)

##### Examples
> - Database mining 
> - Applications can’t program by hand
> - Self-customizing programs
> - Understanding human learning



Machine Learning algorithms

1. Supervised Learning 
	- regression (continuous) 
	- classification (discrete)

2. UnsuperVised Learning
	- clustering 
	- non - clustering (ex - cocktail party Algorithm)

Others 

	 Reinforcement learning, recommendersystems, e.t.c...


## Linear Regression with One Variable

	Hypothesis : Hθ(x) = θ0 + θ1 * x
	Prameters : θ0, θ1
	Cost Functions : J(θ0,θ1) = 1/2m Σ(i=1 to m) h(x^(i)) - y^(i))^2
	
where do we use Cost Functions? -> to minimize J(θ0, θ1)

keep changing parameters to reduce J(θ0, θ1)
